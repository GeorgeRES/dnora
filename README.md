What is DNORA?
DNORA is a software for dynamical downscaling of NORA3 wave hindcast.

DNORA is used to:
- create high resolution grid from open access Emodnet 2018 bathymetry within the NORA3 domain
- create wind forcing and 2d spectra at the boundaries based on NORA3
- create parameter file(s) for the spectral model (SWAN and soon WW3)
- use a multiple-component calibration
- run the spectral model
